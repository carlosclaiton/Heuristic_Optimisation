# Heuristic_Optimisation
Using heuristic methods implemented in Matlab and in Python to solve the optimisation problem proposed by N. Order in the priority list [N. Order, Phalanx42, 23 (2009)].

BPSO => Binary Particle Swarm optimisatlion 

VPSO => V-shaped Particle Swarm optimisation 

QL => Q-learning agent (reinforcement learning)

PSEQEA => Particle Swarm Embed Quantum-inspired Evolutionary Algorithm

We also compare the performance of the two languages (python and matlab). In this set of codes we also solve the subset of Quadratic Knapsack problem (Cubic Graphic) in order to check the performance of the implementations as the number of decision variables increase.
