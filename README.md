# Heuristic_Optimisation
Using heuristic methods implemented in Matlab and in Python to solve the optimisation problem proposed by N. Order in the priority list [N. Order, Phalanx42, 23 (2009)] and a cubic graph modeled as quadratic Knapsack Problem to investigate the scabilability of the algorithms

BPSO => Binary Particle Swarm optimisatlion 

VPSO => V-shaped Particle Swarm optimisation 

QL => Q-learning agent (reinforcement learning)

PSEQEA => Particle Swarm Embed Quantum-inspired Evolutionary Algorithm

We also compare the performance of the two languages (python and matlab).
